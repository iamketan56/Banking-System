A simple dynamic website that has the following specs<br>
 <i>Flow: Home Page > About  > Services > Transaction => Make Transaction  || Add New Customer || View All Customer || Transaction History > My Account.</i><br><br>
 <b>This website is with  User View:</b>
 <br><b> Description : </b> in this project, I have made some sections that are mentioned above.  Like details about the bank and services that they are providing.<br>  In the transaction section, I have made 4 subsections (make the transaction, add user, view all user, transaction history ).<br>
This is the core part of the project. <br>
This is totally dynamic means the transaction will reflect all the sections.
